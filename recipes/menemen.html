    <p>
      Menemen is a traditional Turkish dish which includes eggs, tomatoes, green

      garlic, and salt. It is commonly eaten for breakfast and is served with
      bread.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>
        1 1/2 cups diced fresh peppers (any mix of sweet and chile peppers)
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup diced onion (optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>
        1/4 teaspoon Aleppo chili flakes, or any chili flakes, plus more to
        taste
      </li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups diced or chopped fresh or canned tomato</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese or mozzarella</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cilantro leaves</li>
      <li>crusty baguette, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt butter in olive oil over medium-high heat. Add peppers, onions, and
        salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften
        and start to brown around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in oregano, chili flakes, black pepper, and tomato, and bring to a
        simmer; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until vegetables are tender,
        about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in half the cheese, and as soon as it melts, add the eggs. Break
        yolks with the tip of a spoon, and stir into the tomato mixture for
        anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the final
        texture you want. The longer you stir the eggs, the smoother and
        creamier your menemen will be. If you prefer larger, identifiable pieces
        of egg, closer to classic scrambled eggs, then only stir in the eggs
        briefly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook on low until eggs are as set as you like, about 3
        minutes. Turn off heat, and top with remaining cheese and a drizzle of
        olive oil, and another shake of chili flakes. Top with cilantro, and
        serve with lots of crusty bread or toast.
      </li>
    </ol>
